This version of sablecc includes changes to SableCC 3.2 made locally
at Amherst College by Lyle A. McGeoch (lam@cs.amherst.edu).  Affected
files in src/org/sablecc/sablecc are:

SableCC.java:

1.  Changed the description of the program to reflect the fact that
this is the Amherst version.

2.  Added --amh-dump as a new option.  This causes information on item
sets to be dumped in the file "parser.dump", which is created in the
user's current directory when sablecc is run.

Grammar.java:

1.  Modified to support creation of parser.dump.

GenAnalyses.java:

1.  Modified to enable creation of a new analysis program, AmhTraversal.java.

analyses.txt:

1.  Modified to support creation of AmhTraversal.java.

parser.txt:

1.  Modified so that "unchecked" warnings are not produced when a user
compiles Parser.java as part of his or her compiler.
